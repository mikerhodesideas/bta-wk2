You are tasked with creating a Google Ads script that reads settings from a Google Sheet, classifies search terms using AI models, and outputs the results. Follow these instructions carefully:

note you do NOT need to access a google ads account at all in this script.
data will be read from & to a google sheet
and you'll use an LLM to classify search terms

this script will run inside a google asd account though

so use javascript that can run in a google ads script. important!

instruxtions: 
1. Use the  Google Sheets URL to access the settings provided by user

Read the following settings from the sheet:
model (one of: openai, anthropic, google)
cheap (yes or no)
topTerms (a list of search terms to classify)

Define the following classification categories for search terms:
<enum>
INFORMATIONAL: Queries seeking general information
NAVIGATIONAL: Queries looking for a specific website or page
COMMERCIAL: Queries with buying intent
TRANSACTIONAL: Queries indicating immediate purchase intent
LOCAL: Queries related to local businesses or services
QUESTION: Queries phrased as questions </enum>

Structure your main function as follows:
a. Read settings from the sheet
b. Validate the settings
c. Classify each search term using the specified model
d. Output results back to the sheet

Implement API calls for each model:
keys are in named ranges as per image - use keys prefixed with mike if present, otherwise fallback to key ones

For each model, use the 'cheap' setting to determine which model version to use:
Implement error handling and logging:
Log all API calls, their duration, and responses
Handle API errors gracefully, retrying failed calls up to 3 times
Log any persistent errors to the sheet

Output results:
Create a new sheet named "Results"
Output each search term with its classification and confidence score (if available)


+ added code for the 3 test apikey scripts
